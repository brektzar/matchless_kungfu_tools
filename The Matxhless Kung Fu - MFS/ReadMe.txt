Original script made by Lemiru, i just changed some things and put a GUI on it.
All credit goes to Lemiru.

This script sorts your inner kung fu in the shortest possible path for your meridian sequence.
You select which abilities you want in the list and click ok, if you reach over 45 you will get a message saying it dint work, 45 is currently the max length of your meridian sequence.
